folder description

the major lines of thought in this folder are:

1. try to understand the "Fraundorf" graphic
   and reprogram the single graphs there via maxima
   just to better understand myself

2. playing around with various concepts that 
   have to be taken with a grain of salt because
   there might be smaller or bigger logic errors
   the aim is to experience and use them

3. plot all sorts of fft in maxima
   see how the char encoding appears im maxima and
   display together with its relation to the 
   fft concept to build a understanding of
   that visiually

explainStelsels.wxmx* 

is best because it only deals with 3. all other wxmx files in this folder deal with 1. 2. 3.
